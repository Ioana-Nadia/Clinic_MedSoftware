# Clinic_MedSoftware
  I have created this project this year.
  It is also my first more complex application. For this, I have used Python, Django, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  I was inspired by a dental clinic, where I go quite often for orthodontic treatment. The secretary could not find the papers with the appointments, the files of some patients, sometimes she did not understand the writing, in other words, there was chaos there due to the inefficient organization of the schedule.
  A lot of paper was also used, nature must be protected. For this reason, the logo has a drawing with a tree and a suggestive message below. I have decided that a change was needed and I have created the Clinic_MedSoftware application.
  Any clinic in the world can create an account (with name, email and address, and password) on this application and the profile is the place where its data can be stored. Clinic_MedSoftware is strictly for staff, clients do not have access to the clinic's database. We can store all the necessary information about patients(first name, last name, address, email, phone, personal identification number, allergies, treatments, and diseases), interventions (name) but also doctors(first name, last name, phone, and email).
  The above data can be edited whenever the staff wants.
  The program can also be moved to this application. Each doctor of the clinic has its own digital calendar in which the secretary can delete or add appointments by selecting the person from the list of patients and the intervention from the list of options. 
  It's that simple to improve the schedule.
